### Hi there 👋 I am 👑KoredeDavid a FullStack Web Developer👨🏾‍💻 from Nigeria🌟



### 🎨 Here are some of my works 🎨:
  1. <a href="https://concealme.heroku.com"> Conceal </a> : Here is a website that can allow you to receive anonymous messages from your friends. It uses
  Telegram API to enable users view messages on Telegram. It uses Python (Django), Microsoft Azure and
  PostgreSQL for the backend, manipulates DOM elements with JavaScript (jQuery) and also designed with
  HTML and CSS(Bootstrap).

  2. <a href="https://iedutech.herokuapp.com"> iEdutech </a>: This is just a simple project to showcase my Front End skills with JavaScript and Ajax requests. Django was used     to develop the Back-End and it stores users favourite courses securely using sessions stored in the web browser and on the PostgreSQL server

### 🚧 Work in progress 🚧:  
  - Attendance Management System: At my local assembly this in-house app should help to mark the
     attendance of children. It uses Python (Django) for the backend with HTML, CSS and JavaScript for good
     visualisation of data.
